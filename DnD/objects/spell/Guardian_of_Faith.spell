The guardian occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.\n\nAny creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.",
